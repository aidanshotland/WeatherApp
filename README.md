# Weather Forecast App

This is a simple weather forecast app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. You can search for the weather in any location, toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and see a fun weather-related GIF. The app uses the Visual Crossing Weather API and the Giphy API. To keep API keys secure, Vercel serverless functions are used so keys are never exposed in the frontend. The project is deployed using Vercel.
